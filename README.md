# **Debian Auto updater** (updategrade.sh)

Bash script to update, upgrade and remove all packages
My first try on bash scripting :)

## **Usage**

`git clone` the repository 
 
`cp updategrade.sh /usr/local/bin` (rename as you like)

`cd /usr/local/bin`

Change permissions for the .sh file with `chmod +x updategrade.sh` (requires sudo)

type `updategrade.sh` anywhere on the terminal to do all task automatically. 

Works on Debian releases.
